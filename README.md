# LasersGUI
An RIT Computer Science 2 project that consisted of creating a GUI for a game that the faculty created that included lasers and bank vaults that goblins stored their prized possessions.

The first part of the project consisted of making a model for a game (designed by RIT faculty) that operated with a plain text user interface(PTUI) and could be run on the command line.
The second part was implementing a backtracking algorithm that could solve the game and building a graphical user interface(GUI) for the game. The GUI used JavaFX and followed the 
model-view-controller pattern. After the project was completed either the PTUI or GUI could be used depending on the program arguments when run.
